# vim-configs

### Enhance your vim with quick, simple, useful and nice settings:
- .vimrc: shortcut keys, line numbers, relative line numbers, between other common configurations.
- gruvbox: nice smooth style. 
- easymotion: to make complex jumps easily.
- autoclose: to auto close things like brackets, parentheses...

### How to use:
1. Clone this repo.
2. `cd vim-configs`.
3. Add execution rights to `setup.sh` with `chmod +x setup.sh`.
4. Run the script `./setup.sh`. It configures vim for the user that runs the command (as each user has its own config). So, to configure the root user's vim run `sudo ./setup.sh`.
